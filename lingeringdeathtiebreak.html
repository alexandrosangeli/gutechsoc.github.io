<p>I don't know if anyone will ever find this, it was a long shot anyway.
  Who knows, perhaps they already know I'm a traitor. No, they still don't
  know about the Warez, I should be safe for now. RED have crossed the line
  once more into WHTE territory, but I can't give anything too specific away
  here. Hopefully you have already solved the puzzles I managed to hide in the
  video, but you're not done yet. There are 3 3-letter words hidden in that
  video. Together they form an anagram of a place name. That is one of the 3
  code words. There are another 2 hidden in the following picture. If you can
  manage to find them all, pass them along to Blue CEO, Albert MacDonald, in
  person. It may not appear to mean anything but he'll understand. I just only
  hope I'm not too late
